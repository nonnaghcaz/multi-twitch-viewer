Multi Twitch Viewer
===================

![Example Screenshot](docs/example-screenshot.png)

Multi Twitch Viewer is a simple MV3 Chrome extension designed to easily allow keeping track of, creating MultiStre.am links for, and simultaneously watching your favorite Twitch streamers.

This is my first real attempt at making a function Chrome extension, so there are sure to be issues.

Nothing in the chrome store, you need to load unpacked to use.

No affiliation with Twitch or MultiStre.am.
